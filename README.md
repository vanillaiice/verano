# Verano

Library to manage activities in a project.
This project is inspired by the 'Primavera' or P6 software (Spring in Spanish), hence the name 'Verano'.

# Motivation

- Understand how P6 works behind the scenes.
- Adding activities one by one in P6 is quite time consuming.
- Provide a Free and Open Source Alternative to P6.
- Better my Go coding skills.
