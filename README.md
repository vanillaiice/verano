# Verano

Library to manage activities in a project.
This project is inspired by the 'Primavera' or P6 software (Spring in Spanish), hence the name 'Verano' (Summer in Spanish).

# Motivation

- Understand how P6 works under the hood.
- Adding activities one by one in P6 is quite time consuming.
- Provide a Free and Open Source Alternative to P6.
- Enhance my Go coding skills.

# Installation

# inside a Go module, execute the following command:
$ go get github.com/vanillaiice/verano
